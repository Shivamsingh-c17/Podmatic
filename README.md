## Inspiration
In today’s world, Podcasters are struggling for monetary benefits for their work. The royalty distribution in its present form makes it difficult to keep the fair share of revenue podcasters generate on existing platforms. Moreover, there’s no transparent and decentralized platform for the same.

## What it does
Podmatic is a decentralized platform that aims to uplift podcasters by enabling them to create NFTs of their podcasts and provide them with the royalties and recognition that they deserve. Podmatic is more than just an NFT marketplace for podcasters and fans. It will bring them together like never before and unlock novel models of communications and commerce.

## How we built it
We have created a platform through which podcasters can raise money by selling their podcasts as NFTs, while fans can support and form closer connections with their idols by purchasing a real stake in their careers. It helps fans connect on a deeper level with their idols through all the features we have on the platform. By basing the Podmatic platform on the Polygon blockchain and storing all the tracks on IPFS, there is no central server and so the storage costs are drastically reduced. This allows for more of the revenue to go directly to the podcasters, in a more secure, transparent, and decentralized way than ever before.

## Challenges we ran into
The most important phase in the product development was thinking about what the podcast community really needs. We've talked to a lot of podcasters and think that we're very close to nailing it down to the minute details.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The team is very proud of turning around this project in a very short period of time during the hackathon.

## What we learned
We learnt several skills that included things from website development, web3, blockchain, crypto, NFTs, talking to people for gathering feedback, making the product a good market-fit, etc.
